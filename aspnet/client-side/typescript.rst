|stub-icon| Introducing TypeScript
==================================
.. By `Noel Rice`_

.. TypeScript helps you build enterprise scale applications on the client with the same smooth development experience, reliability, and scalability that you expect from a .NET language. TypeScript lets you work with familiar abstractions like strong types, interfaces, classes, namespaces, enums, generics, and lambda expressions. TypeScript code editors have intelligent code completion (Intellisense in Visual Studio) and navigation between object definitions and their references. When youâ€™re done coding, TypeScript compiles to pure JavaScript, leaving no TypeScript artifacts behind.
