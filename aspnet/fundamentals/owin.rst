OWIN
====

By `Steve Smith`_

ASP.NET Core supports OWIN, the Open Web Interface for .NET, which allows web applications to be decoupled from web servers. In addition, OWIN defines a standard way for middleware to be used in a pipeline to handle individual requests and associated responses. ASP.NET Core applications and middleware can interoperate with OWIN-based applications, servers, and middleware.

Running OWIN middleware in the ASP.NET pipeline
-----------------------------------------------

ASP.NET Core's OWIN support is deployed as part of the ``Microsoft.AspNetCore.Owin`` package. You can import OWIN support into your project by adding this package as a dependency in your *project.json* file, as shown here:

.. literalinclude:: owin/sample/src/OwinSample/project.json
  :language: javascript
  :lines: 7-11
  :emphasize-lines: 4

OWIN middleware conform to the `OWIN specification <http://owin.org/spec/spec/owin-1.0.0.html>`_, which defines a Properties ``IDictionary<string, object>`` interface that must be used, and also requires certain keys be set (such as ``owin.ResponseBody``). We can construct a very simple example of middleware that follows the OWIN specification to display "Hello World", as shown here:

.. literalinclude:: owin/sample/src/OwinSample/Startup.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 27-40
  :dedent: 8

In the above example, notice that the method returns a ``Task`` and accepts an ``IDictionary<string, object>`` as required by OWIN. Within the method, this parameter is used to retrieve the ``owin.ResponseBody`` and ``owin.ResponseHeaders`` objects from the environment dictionary. Once the headers are set appropriately for the content being returned, a task representing the asynchronous write to the response stream is returned.

Adding OWIN middleware to the ASP.NET pipeline is most easily done using the ``UseOwin`` extension method. Given the ``OwinHello`` method shown above, adding it to the pipeline is a simple matter:

.. literalinclude:: owin/sample/src/OwinSample/Startup.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 19-25
  :dedent: 8

You can of course configure other actions to take place within the OWIN pipeline. Remember that response headers should only be modified prior to the first write to the response stream, so configure your pipeline accordingly.

.. note:: Multiple calls to ``UseOwin`` is discouraged for performance reasons. OWIN components will operate best if grouped together.

.. code-block:: c#

  app.UseOwin(pipeline =>
  {
      pipeline(next =>
    {
        // do something before
        return OwinHello;
        // do something after
    });
  });

.. note:: The OWIN support in ASP.NET Core is an evolution of the work that was done for the `Katana project <http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/>`_. Katana's ``IAppBuilder`` component has been replaced by ``IApplicationBuilder``, but if you have existing Katana-based middleware, you can use it within your ASP.NET Core application through the use of a bridge, as shown in the `Owin.IAppBuilderBridge example on GitHub <https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/tree/master/samples/Owin.IAppBuilderBridge>`_. 

Using ASP.NET Hosting on an OWIN-based server
---------------------------------------------

OWIN-based servers can host ASP.NET applications, since ASP.NET conforms to the OWIN specification. One such server is `Nowin <https://github.com/Bobris/Nowin>`_, a .NET OWIN web server. In the sample for this article, I've included a very simple project that references Nowin and uses it to create a simple server capable of self-hosting ASP.NET Core.

.. literalinclude:: owin/sample/src/NowinSample/NowinServerFactory.cs
  :emphasize-lines: 13,19,22,27,41
  :linenos:
  :language: c#

IServerFactory_ is an interface that requires an Initialize and a Start method. Initialize must return an instance of IFeatureCollection_, which we populate with a ``INowinServerInformation`` that includes the server's name (the specific implementation may provide additional functionality). In this example, the ``NowinServerInformation`` class is defined as a private class within the factory, and is returned by ``Initialize`` as required.

``Initialize`` is responsible for configuring the server, which in this case is done through a series of fluent API calls that hard code the server to listen for requests (to any IP address) on port 5000. Note that the final line of the fluent configuration of the ``builder`` variable specifies that requests will be handled by the private method ``HandleRequest``.

``Start`` is called after ``Initialize`` and accepts the the IFeatureCollection_ created by ``Initialize``, and a callback of type ``Func<IFeatureCollection, Task>``. This callback is assigned to a local field and is ultimately called on each request from within the private ``HandleRequest`` method (which was wired up in ``Initialize``).

With this in place, all that's required to run an ASP.NET application using this custom server is the following command in *project.json*:

.. literalinclude:: owin/sample/src/NowinSample/project.json
  :emphasize-lines: 14
  :linenos:
  :language: json
  :lines: 1-16

When run, this command will search for a package called "NowinSample" that contains an implementation of ``IServerFactory``. If it finds one, it will initialize and start the server as detailed above. Learn more about the built-in ASP.NET :doc:`/fundamentals/servers`.

Run ASP.NET Core on an OWIN-based server and use its WebSockets support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another example of how OWIN-based servers' features can be leveraged by ASP.NET Core is access to features like WebSockets. The .NET OWIN web server used in the previous example has support for Web Sockets built in, which can be leveraged by an ASP.NET Core application. The example below shows a simple web application that supports Web Sockets and simply echos back anything sent to the server via WebSockets.

.. literalinclude:: owin/sample/src/NowinWebSockets/Startup.cs
  :lines: 11-
  :language: c#
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 7, 9-10

This `sample  <https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnet/fundamentals/owin/sample>`__ is configured using the same ``NowinServerFactory`` as the previous one - the only difference is in how the application is configured in its ``Configure`` method. A simple test using `a simple websocket client <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-websocket-client/pfdhoblngboilpfeibdedpjgfnlcodoo?hl=en>`_ demonstrates that the application works as expected:

OWIN keys
---------

OWIN depends heavily on an ``IDictionary<string,object>`` used to communicate information throughout an HTTP Request/Response exchange. ASP.NET Core implements all of the required and optional keys outlined in the OWIN specification, as well as some of its own. Note that any keys not required in the OWIN specification are optional and may only be used in some scenarios. When working with OWIN keys, it's a good idea to review the list of `OWIN Key Guidelines and Common Keys <http://owin.org/spec/spec/CommonKeys.html>`_
