.. WARNING::
  Data Protection is used by various ASP.NET middlewares, including those used in authentication. Even if you do not specifically call any Data Protection APIs from your own code you should configure Data Protection with the deployment script or in your own code. If you do not configure data protection when using IIS by default the keys will be held in memory and discarded when your application closes or restarts. This will then, for example, invalidate any cookies written by the cookie authentication and users will have to login again.
