Custom Policy-Based Authorization
=================================

Underneath the covers the :ref:`role authorization <security-authorization-role-based>` and :ref:`claims authorization <security-authorization-claims-based>` make use of a requirement, a handler for the requirement and a pre-configured policy. These building blocks allow you to express authorization evaluations in code, allowing for a richer, reusable, and easily testable authorization structure. 

An authorization policy is made up of one or more requirements and registered at application startup as part of the Authorization service configuration, which normally takes part in`` ConfigureServices()`` in your ``startup.cs`` file.

.. code-block:: c#

 public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
 {
     services.AddMvc();

     services.AddAuthorization(options =>
     {
         options.AddPolicy("Over21", 
                           policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21)));
     }
 });

Here you can see an Over21 policy is created with a single requirement, that of a minimum age, which is passed as a parameter to the requirement.

Policies are applied using the ``Authorize`` attribute simply by specifying the policy name, for example

.. code-block:: c#

  [Authorize(Policy="Over21")]
  public class AlcholPurchaseRequirementsController : Controller
  {  
      public ActionResult Login()
      {      
      }

      public ActionResult Logout()
      {      
      }
  }

Requirements
------------
An authorization requirement is a collection of data parameters that a policy can use to evaluate the current user principal. In our Minimum Age policy the requirement we have a single parameter, the minimum age. A requirement must implement the ``IAuthorizationRequirement``. This is an empty, marker interface. A parameterized minimum age requirement might be implemented as follows;

.. code-block:: c#

 public class MinimumAgeRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement
 {
     public MinimumAgeRequirement(int age)
     {
         MinimumAge = age;
     }

     protected int MinimumAge { get; set; }
 }

A requirement doesn't have to have any data or properties.

.. _security-authorization-policies-based-authorization-handler:

Authorization Handlers
----------------------

An authorization handler is responsible for evaluation any properties of a requirement and evaluate them against a provided AuthorizationContext to make a decision if authorization is allowed. A requirement can have :ref:`multiple handlers <security-authorization-policies-based-multiple-handlers>`. Handlers must inherit ``AuthorizationHandler<T>`` where T is the requirement they handle. 

.. _security-authorization-handler-example:

Our minimum age handler might look like so;

.. code-block:: c#

 public class MinimumAgeHandler : AuthorizationHandler<MinimumAgeRequirement>
 {
     protected override void Handle(AuthorizationContext context, MinimumAgeRequirement requirement)
     {
         if (!context.User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.DateOfBirth && 
                                    c.Issuer == "http://contoso.com"))
         {
             return;
         }

         var dateOfBirth = Convert.ToDateTime(context.User.FindFirst(
             c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.DateOfBirth && c.Issuer == "http://contoso.com").Value);

         int calculatedAge = DateTime.Today.Year - dateOfBirth.Year;
         if (dateOfBirth > DateTime.Today.AddYears(-calculatedAge))
         {
             calculatedAge--;
         }

         if (calculatedAge >= requirement.MinimumAge)
         {
             context.Succeed(requirement);
         }
     }
 }

In the code above we first look to see if the current user principal has a date of birth claim which has been issued by an Issuer we know and trust. If the claim is missing we can't authorize so we return. If we have a claim we figure out how old the user is, and if they meet the minimum age passed in by the requirement then authorization has been successful, so we call ``context.Succeed()`` passing in the requirement that has been successful as a parameter.

.. _security-authorization-policies-based-handler-registration:

Handlers must be registered in the services collection during configuration, for example;

.. code-block:: c#

 public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
 {
     services.AddMvc();

     services.AddAuthorization(options =>
     {
         options.AddPolicy("Over21", 
                           policy => policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21)));
     });

     services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, MinimumAgeHandler>();
 }

Each handler is added to the services collection by using ``services.AddSingleton<IAuthorizationHandler, YourHandlerClass>();`` passing in your handler class.

What should a handler return?
-----------------------------

You can see in our :ref:`handler example <security-authorization-handler-example>` that the ``Handle()`` method has no return value, so how do we indicate success or failure?

* A handler indicates success by calling ``context.Succeed(IAuthorizationRequirement requirement)``, passing the requirement that has been successfully validate.
* A handler does not need to handle failures generally, as other handlers for the same requirement may succeed.
* In catastrophic cases, where you want to ensure failure even if other handlers for a requirement succeed you can call ``context.Fail()``. 
 
Regardless of what you call inside your handler all handlers for a requirement will be called when a policy requires the requirement. This allows requirements to have side effects, such as logging, which will always take place even if ``context.Fail()`` has been called in another handler.

.. _security-authorization-policies-based-multiple-handlers:

Why would I want multiple handlers for a requirement?
-----------------------------------------------------

In cases where you want evaluation to be on an OR basis you implement multiple handlers for a single requirement. For example, Microsoft has doors which only open with key cards, or when the reception opens the door for you because you left your key card at home, and she has printed out a single day sticker of forgetful shame you must wear. In this sort of scenario you'd have a single requirement, EnterBuilding, but multiple handlers, each one examining a single requirement. 

.. code-block:: c#

 public class EnterBuildingRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement
 {
 }

 public class BadgeEntryHandler : AuthorizationHandler<EnterBuildingRequirement>
 {
     protected override void Handle(AuthorizationContext context, EnterBuildingRequirement requirement)
     {
         if (context.User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.BadgeId && 
                                        c.Issuer == "http://microsoftsecurity"))
         {
             context.Succeed(requirement);
         }
     }
 }

 public class HasTemporaryStickerOfShameHandler : AuthorizationHandler<EnterBuildingRequirement>
 {
     protected override void Handle(AuthorizationContext context, EnterBuildingRequirement requirement)
     {
         if (context.User.HasClaim(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.TemporaryBadgeId && 
                                        c.Issuer == "http://microsoftsecurity"))
         {
             // We'd also check the expiration date on the sticker.
             context.Succeed(requirement);
         }
     }
 }

Now, assuming both handlers are :ref:`registered <security-authorization-policies-based-handler-registration>` when a policy evaluates the EnterBuildingRequirement if either handler succeeds the policy evaluation will succeed.

Accessing Request Context In Handlers
-------------------------------------

The Handle method you must implement in a handle has two parameters, an ``AuthorizationContext`` and the ``Requirement`` you are handling. Frameworks such as MVC or Jabbr are free to add any object to the ``Resource`` property on the AuthorizationContext to pass through extra information.

For example MVC passes an instance of ``Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Filters.AuthorizationContext`` in the resource property which be used to access HttpContext, RouteData and everything else MVC provides.

As the use of the Resource property is framework specific using information it will limit your authorization policies to particular frameworks. You should cast the Resource property using the ``as`` keyword, then check the cast has succeed to ensure your code doesn't crash with InvalidCastExceptions() when run other other frameworks;

.. code-block:: c#
 
 var mvcContext = context.Resource as Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Filters.AuthorizationContext;

 if (mvcContext != null)
 {
     // Examine MVC specific things like routing data.
 }
