Adding a model
==================================================
By `Rick Anderson`_


In this section you'll add some classes for managing movies in a database. These classes will be the "**M**\odel" part of the **M**\VC app.

Youâ€™ll use a .NET Framework data-access technology known as the `Entity Framework Core <http://ef.readthedocs.org/>`__ to define and work with these data model classes. Entity Framework Core (often referred to as **EF** Core) features a development paradigm called *Code First*. You write the code first, and the database tables are created from this code. Code First allows you to create data model objects by writing simple classes. (These are also known as POCO classes, from "plain-old CLR objects.") The database is created from your classes. If you are required to create the database first, you can still follow this tutorial to learn about MVC and EF app development.

Adding data model classes
--------------------------

In Solution Explorer, right click the *Models* folder > **Add** > **Class**. Name the class **Movie** and add the following properties:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Models/MovieNoEF.cs
  :language: c#
  :lines: 4-16
  :dedent: 0
  :emphasize-lines: 7

In addition to the properties you'd expect to model a movie, the ``ID`` field is required by the DB for the primary key. Build the project. If you don't build the app, you'll get an error in the next section. We've finally added a **M**\odel to our **M**\VC app.

Scaffolding a controller
-------------------------

In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the *Controllers* folder **> Add > Controller**.

.. image:: adding-model/_static/add_controller.png

In the **Add Scaffold** dialog, tap **MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework > Add**.

.. image:: adding-model/_static/add_scaffold2.png

Complete the **Add Controller** dialog

- **Model class:** *Movie(MvcMovie.Models)*
- **Data context class:** *ApplicationDbContext(MvcMovie.Models)*
- **Views:**: Keep the default of each option checked
- **Controller name:** Keep the default *MoviesController*
- Tap **Add**

.. image:: adding-model/_static/add_controller2.png

The Visual Studio scaffolding engine creates the following:

- A movies controller (*Controllers/MoviesController.cs*)
- Create, Delete, Details, Edit and Index Razor view files (*Views/Movies*)

Visual Studio automatically created the `CRUD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>`__ (create, read, update, and delete) action methods and views for you (the automatic creation of CRUD action methods and views is known as *scaffolding*). You'll soon have a fully functional web application that lets you create, list, edit, and delete movie entries.

Run the app and click on the **Mvc Movie** link. You'll get the following error:

.. image:: adding-model/_static/pending.png

That's a great error message, we'll follow those instructions to get the database ready for our Movie app.

Use data migrations to create the database
--------------------------------------------

- Open a command prompt in the project directory (MvcMovie/src/MvcMovie). Follow these instructions for a quick way to open a folder in the project directory.

  - Open a file in the root of the project (for this example, use *Startup.cs*.)
  - Right click on *Startup.cs*  **> Open Containing Folder**.

  .. image:: adding-model/_static/quick.png

  - Shift + right click a folder > **Open command window here**

  .. image:: adding-model/_static/folder.png

  - Run ``cd ..`` to move back up to the project directory

- Run the following commands in the command prompt:

.. code-block:: console

  dotnet ef migrations add Initial
  dotnet ef database update

- ``dotnet`` (.NET Core) is a cross-platform implementation of .NET. You can read about it `here <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=798644>`__.
- ``dotnet ef migrations add Initial`` Runs the Entity Framework .NET Core CLI migrations command and creates the initial migration. The parameter "Initial" is arbitrary, but customary for the first (*initial*) database migration. This operation creates the *Data/Migrations/2016<date-time>_Initial.cs* file containing the migration commands to add (or drop) the `Movie` table to the database.

- ``dotnet ef database update``  Updates the database with the migration we just created.


Test the app
------------------

- Run the app and tap the **Mvc Movie** link
- Tap the **Create New** link and create a movie

.. image:: adding-model/_static/movies.png

.. note:: You may not be able to enter decimal points or commas in the ``Price`` field. To support `jQuery validation <http://jqueryvalidation.org/>`__ for non-English locales that use a comma (",") for a decimal point, and non US-English date formats, you must take steps to globalize your app. See `Additional resources`_ for more information. For now, just enter whole numbers like 10.

Tapping **Create** causes the form to be posted to the server, where the movie information is saved in a database. You are then redirected to the `/Movies` URL, where you can see the newly created movie in the listing.

.. image:: adding-model/_static/h.png

Create a couple more movie entries. Try the **Edit**, **Details**, and **Delete** links, which are all functional.

Examining the Generated Code
---------------------------------

Open the *Controllers/MoviesController.cs* file and examine the generated ``Index`` method. A portion of the movie controller with the ``Index`` method is shown below:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/MoviesController.cs
 :language: c#
 :lines: 295-307

The constructor uses :doc:`Dependency Injection  </fundamentals/dependency-injection>` to inject the database context into the controller. The database context is used in each of the `CRUD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>`__ methods in the controller.

A request to the Movies controller returns all the entries in the ``Movies`` table and then passes the data to the ``Index`` view.

Strongly typed models and the @model keyword
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Earlier in this tutorial, you saw how a controller can pass data or objects to a view template using the ``ViewData`` dictionary. The ``ViewData`` dictionary is a dynamic object that provides a convenient late-bound way to pass information to a view.

MVC also provides the ability to pass strongly typed objects to a view template. This strongly typed approach enables better compile-time checking of your code and richer `IntelliSense <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hcw1s69b.aspx>`__ in Visual Studio (VS). The scaffolding mechanism in VS used this approach (that is, passing a strongly typed model) with the ``MoviesController`` class and view templates when it created the methods and views.

Examine the generated ``Details`` method in the *Controllers/MoviesController.cs* file:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/MoviesController.cs
 :language: c#
 :lines: 29-45
 :dedent: 8

The ``id`` parameter is generally passed as route data, for example ``http://localhost:1234/movies/details/1`` sets:

- The controller to the ``movies`` controller (the first URL segment)
- The action to ``details`` (the second URL segment)
- The id to 1 (the last URL segment)

You could also pass in the ``id`` with a query string as follows:

``http://localhost:1234/movies/details?id=1``

If a Movie is found, an instance of the ``Movie`` model is passed to the ``Details`` view:

.. code-block:: C#

  return View(movie);

.. make a copy of details - later we add Ratings to it.

Examine the contents of the *Views/Movies/Details.cshtml* file:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/Movies/DetailsOriginal.cshtml
 :language: HTML
 :emphasize-lines: 1

By including a ``@model`` statement at the top of the view template file, you can specify the type of object that the view expects. When you created the movie controller, Visual Studio automatically included the following ``@model`` statement at the top of the *Details.cshtml* file:

.. code-block:: HTML

  @model MvcMovie.Models.Movie

This ``@model`` directive allows you to access the movie that the controller passed to the view by using a ``Model`` object that's strongly typed. For example, in the *Details.cshtml* template, the code passes each movie field to the ``DisplayNameFor`` and ``DisplayFor`` HTML Helpers with the strongly typed ``Model`` object. The ``Create`` and ``Edit`` methods and view templates also pass a ``Movie`` model object.

Examine the *Index.cshtml* view template and the ``Index`` method in the Movies controller. Notice how the code creates a ``List`` object when it calls the View method. The code passes this ``Movies`` list from the ``Index`` action method to the view:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/MoviesController.cs
 :language: c#
 :lines: 24-27
 :dedent: 8

When you created the movies controller, Visual Studio automatically included the following ``@model`` statement at the top of the *Index.cshtml* file:

.. Copy Index.cshtml to IndexOriginal.cshtml

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/Movies/IndexOriginal.cshtml
 :language: HTML
 :lines: 1

The ``@model`` directive allows you to access the list of movies that the controller passed to the view by using a ``Model`` object that's strongly typed. For example, in the *Index.cshtml* template, the code loops through the movies with a ``foreach`` statement over the strongly typed ``Model`` object:

.. Copy Index.cshtml to IndexOriginal.cshtml

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/Movies/IndexOriginal.cshtml
  :language: HTML
  :emphasize-lines: 1,31, 34,37,40,43,46-48

Because the ``Model`` object is strongly typed (as an ``IEnumerable<Movie>`` object), each item in the loop is typed as ``Movie``. Among other benefits, this means that you get compile-time checking of the code and full `IntelliSense <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hcw1s69b.aspx>`__ support in the code editor:

.. image:: adding-model/_static/ints.png

You now have a database and pages to display, edit, update and delete data. In the next tutorial, we'll work with the database.
