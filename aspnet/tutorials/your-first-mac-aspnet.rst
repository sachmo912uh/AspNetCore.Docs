Setting Up Your Development Environment
---------------------------------------

To setup your development machine download and install `.NET Core`_ and `Visual Studio Code`_ with the `C# extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp>`__.

Scaffolding Applications Using Yeoman
-------------------------------------

Follow the instruction in :doc:`/client-side/yeoman` to create an ASP.NET Core project.

Developing ASP.NET Applications on a Mac With Visual Studio Code
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Start **Visual Studio Code**

.. image:: your-first-mac-aspnet/_static/vscode-welcome.png

- Tap **File > Open** and navigate to your Empty ASP.NET Core app

.. image:: your-first-mac-aspnet/_static/file-open.png

From a Terminal / bash prompt, run ``dotnet restore`` to restore the project's dependencies. Alternately, you can enter ``command shift p`` in Visual Studio Code and then type ``dot`` as shown:

.. image:: your-first-mac-aspnet/_static/dotnet-restore.png

You can run commands directly from within Visual Studio Code, including ``dotnet restore`` and any tools referenced in the *project.json* file, as well as custom tasks defined in *.vscode/tasks.json*.

This empty project template simply displays "Hello World!". Open *Startup.cs* in Visual Studio Code to see how this is configured:

If this is your first time using Visual Studio Code (or just *Code* for short), note that it provides a very streamlined, fast, clean interface for quickly working with files, while still providing tooling to make writing code extremely productive. 

In the left navigation bar, there are four icons, representing four viewlets:

- Explore
- Search
- Git
- Debug

The Explore viewlet allows you to quickly navigate within the folder system, as well as easily see the files you are currently working with. It displays a badge to indicate whether any files have unsaved changes, and new folders and files can easily be created (without having to open a separate dialog window). You can easily Save All from a menu option that appears on mouse over, as well.

The Search viewlet allows you to quickly search within the folder structure, searching filenames as well as contents.

*Code* will integrate with Git if it is installed on your system. You can easily initialize a new repository, make commits, and push changes from the Git viewlet.

The Debug viewlet supports interactive debugging of applications.

Finally, Code's editor has a ton of great features. You'll notice unused using statements are underlined and can be removed automatically by using ``command .`` when the lightbulb icon appears. Classes and methods also display how many references there are in the project to them. If you're coming from Visual Studio, Code includes many of the same keyboard shortcuts, such as ``command k c`` to comment a block of code, and ``command k u`` to uncomment.

Running Locally Using Kestrel
-----------------------------

The sample is configured to use :ref:`Kestrel <kestrel>` for the web server. You can see it configured in the *project.json* file, where it is specified as a dependency.

.. code-block:: json
  :emphasize-lines: 11-12
 
  {
    "version": "1.0.0-*",
    "compilationOptions": {
      "emitEntryPoint": true
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
        "type": "platform",
        "version": "1.0.0-rc2-3002702"
      },
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "1.0.0-rc2-final",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https": "1.0.0-rc2-final",
      "Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console": "1.0.0-rc2-final"
    },
    "frameworks": {
      "netcoreapp1.0": {}
    }
  }


- Run ``dotnet run`` command to launch the app

- Navigate to ``localhost:5000``:

- To stop the web server enter ``Ctrl+C``.


Publishing to Azure
-------------------

Once you've developed your application, you can easily use the Git integration built into Visual Studio Code to push updates to production, hosted on `Microsoft Azure <http://azure.microsoft.com>`_. 

Initialize Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initialize Git in the folder you're working in. Tap on the Git viewlet and click the ``Initialize Git repository`` button.

.. image:: your-first-mac-aspnet/_static/vscode-git-commit.png

Add a commit message and tap enter or tap the checkmark icon to commit the staged files. 

.. image:: your-first-mac-aspnet/_static/init-commit.png

Git is tracking changes, so if you make an update to a file, the Git viewlet will display the files that have changed since your last commit.

Initialize Azure Website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can deploy to Azure Web Apps directly using Git. 

- `Create a new Web App <https://tryappservice.azure.com/>`__ in Azure. If you don't have an Azure account, you can `create a free trial <http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/>`__. 

- Configure the Web App in Azure to support `continuous deployment using Git <http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/>`__.

Record the Git URL for the Web App from the Azure portal:

.. image:: your-first-mac-aspnet/_static/azure-portal.png

- In a Terminal window, add a remote named ``azure`` with the Git URL you noted previously.

  - ``git remote add azure https://ardalis-git@firstaspnetcoremac.scm.azurewebsites.net:443/firstaspnetcoremac.git``

- Push to master.

  - ``git push azure master`` to deploy. 

  .. image:: your-first-mac-aspnet/_static/git-push-azure-master.png

- Browse to the newly deployed web app. You should see ``Hello world!``
