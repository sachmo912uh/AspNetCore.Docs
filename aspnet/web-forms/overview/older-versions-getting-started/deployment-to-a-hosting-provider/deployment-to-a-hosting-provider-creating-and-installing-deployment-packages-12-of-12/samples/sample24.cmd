The 'targetFramework' attribute in the <compilation> element of the Web.config 
file is used only to target version 4.0 and later of the .NET Framework (for 
example, '<compilation targetFramework="4.0">'). The 'targetFramework' attribute 
currently references a version that is later than the installed version of the 
.NET Framework. Specify a valid target version of the .NET Framework, or install 
the required version of the .NET Framework.
