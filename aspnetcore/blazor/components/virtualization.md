# ASP.NET Core Blazor component virtualization

By [Daniel Roth](https://github.com/danroth27)

Improve the perceived performance of component rendering using the Blazor framework's built-in virtualization support. Virtualization is a technique for limiting UI rendering to just the parts that are currently visible. For example, virtualization is helpful when the app must render a long list of items and only a subset of items is required to be visible at any given time. Blazor provides the [`Virtualize` component](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601) that can be used to add virtualization to an app's components.

The `Virtualize` component can be used when:

* Rendering a set of data items in a loop.
* Most of the items aren't visible due to scrolling.
* The rendered items are exactly the same size. When the user scrolls to an arbitrary point, the component can calculate the visible items to show.

Without virtualization, a typical list might use a C# [`foreach`](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in) loop to render each item in the list:

```razor
<div style="height:500px;overflow-y:scroll">
    @foreach (var flight in allFlights)
    {
        <FlightSummary @key="flight.FlightId" Details="@flight.Summary" />
    }
</div>
```

If the list contains thousands of items, then rendering the list may take a long time. The user may experience a noticeable UI lag.

Instead of rendering each item in the list all at one time, replace the [`foreach`](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in) loop with the `Virtualize` component and specify a fixed item source with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.Items%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Only the items that are currently visible are rendered:

```razor
<div style="height:500px;overflow-y:scroll">
    <Virtualize Items="@allFlights" Context="flight">
        <FlightSummary @key="flight.FlightId" Details="@flight.Summary" />
    </Virtualize>
</div>
```

If not specifying a context to the component with `Context`, use the `context` value in the item content template:

```razor
<div style="height:500px;overflow-y:scroll">
    <Virtualize Items="@allFlights">
        <FlightSummary @key="context.FlightId" Details="@context.Summary" />
    </Virtualize>
</div>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The mapping process of model objects to elements and components can be controlled with the [`@key`](xref:mvc/views/razor#key) directive attribute. `@key` causes the diffing algorithm to guarantee preservation of elements or components based on the key's value.
>

> * <xref:blazor/components/index#use-key-to-control-the-preservation-of-elements-and-components>
> * [Razor syntax reference for ASP.NET Core](xref:mvc/views/razor#key)

The `Virtualize` component:

* Calculates how many items to render based on the height of the container and the size of the rendered items.
* Recalculates and rerenders items as the user scrolls.
* Only fetches the slice of records from an external API that correspond to the current visible region, instead of downloading all of the data from the collection.

The item content for the `Virtualize` component can include:

* Plain HTML and Razor code, as the preceding example shows.
* One or more Razor components.
* A mix of HTML/Razor and Razor components.

## Item provider delegate

If you don't want to load all of the items into memory, you can specify an items provider delegate method to the component's <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.ItemsProvider%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> parameter that asynchronously retrieves the requested items on demand. In the following example, the `LoadEmployees` method provides the items to the `Virtualize` component:

```razor
<Virtualize Context="employee" ItemsProvider="@LoadEmployees">
    <p>
        @employee.FirstName @employee.LastName has the 
        job title of @employee.JobTitle.
    </p>
</Virtualize>
```

The items provider receives an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.ItemsProviderRequest>, which specifies the required number of items starting at a specific start index. The items provider then retrieves the requested items from a database or other service and returns them as an <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.ItemsProviderResult%601> along with a count of the total items. The items provider can choose to retrieve the items with each request or cache them so that they're readily available.

A `Virtualize` component can only accept **one item source** from its parameters, so don't attempt to simultaneously use an items provider and assign a collection to `Items`. If both are assigned, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown when the component's parameters are set at runtime.

The following `LoadEmployees` method example loads employees from an `EmployeeService` (not shown):

```csharp
private async ValueTask<ItemsProviderResult<Employee>> LoadEmployees(
    ItemsProviderRequest request)
{
    var numEmployees = Math.Min(request.Count, totalEmployees - request.StartIndex);
    var employees = await EmployeesService.GetEmployeesAsync(request.StartIndex, 
        numEmployees, request.CancellationToken);

    return new ItemsProviderResult<Employee>(employees, totalEmployees);
}
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.RefreshDataAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> instructs the component to rerequest data from its <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.ItemsProvider%2A>. This is useful when external data changes. There's no need to call this when using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.Items%2A>.

## Placeholder

Because requesting items from a remote data source might take some time, you have the option to render a placeholder with item content:

* Use a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.Placeholder%2A> (`<Placeholder>...</Placeholder>`) to display content until the item data is available.
* Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.ItemContent%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to set the item template for the list.

```razor
<Virtualize Context="employee" ItemsProvider="@LoadEmployees">
    <ItemContent>
        <p>
            @employee.FirstName @employee.LastName has the 
            job title of @employee.JobTitle.
        </p>
    </ItemContent>
    <Placeholder>
        <p>
            Loading&hellip;
        </p>
    </Placeholder>
</Virtualize>
```

## Item size

The height of each item in pixels can be set with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.ItemSize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> (default: 50):

```razor
<Virtualize Context="employee" Items="@employees" ItemSize="25">
    ...
</Virtualize>
```

By default, the `Virtualize` component measures the actual rendering size *after* the initial render occurs. Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.ItemSize%2A> to provide an exact item size in advance to assist with accurate initial render performance and to ensure the correct scroll position for page reloads. If the default <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.ItemSize%2A> causes some items to render outside of the currently visible view, a second re-render is triggered. To correctly maintain the browser's scroll position in a virtualized list, the initial render must be correct. If not, users might view the wrong items. 

## Overscan count

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Virtualization.Virtualize%601.OverscanCount%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> determines how many additional items are rendered before and after the visible region. This setting helps to reduce the frequency of rendering during scrolling. However, higher values result in more elements rendered in the page (default: 3):

```razor
<Virtualize Context="employee" Items="@employees" OverscanCount="4">
    ...
</Virtualize>
```

## State changes

When making changes to items rendered by the `Virtualize` component, call <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase.StateHasChanged%2A> to force re-evaluation and rerendering of the component. For more information, see <xref:blazor/components/rendering>.
