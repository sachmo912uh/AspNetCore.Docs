# ASP.NET Core Blazor hosting model configuration

By [Daniel Roth](https://github.com/danroth27), [Mackinnon Buck](https://github.com/MackinnonBuck), and [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex)

This article covers hosting model configuration.

### SignalR cross-origin negotiation for authentication

*This section applies to Blazor WebAssembly.*

To configure SignalR's underlying client to send credentials, such as cookies or HTTP authentication headers:

* Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.WebAssemblyHttpRequestMessageExtensions.SetBrowserRequestCredentials%2A> to set <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Http.BrowserRequestCredentials.Include> on cross-origin [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) requests:

  ```csharp
  public class IncludeRequestCredentialsMessageHandler : DelegatingHandler
  {
      protected override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(
          HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      {
          request.SetBrowserRequestCredentials(BrowserRequestCredentials.Include);
          return base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
      }
  }
  ```

* Assign the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpMessageHandler> to the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client.HttpConnectionOptions.HttpMessageHandlerFactory> option:

  ```csharp
  var connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
      .WithUrl(new Uri("http://signalr.example.com"), options =>
      {
          options.HttpMessageHandlerFactory = innerHandler => 
              new IncludeRequestCredentialsMessageHandler { InnerHandler = innerHandler };
      }).Build();
  ```

For more information, see <xref:signalr/configuration#configure-additional-options>.

## Reflect the connection state in the UI

*This section applies to Blazor Server.*

When the client detects that the connection has been lost, a default UI is displayed to the user while the client attempts to reconnect. If reconnection fails, the user is provided the option to retry.

To customize the UI, define an element with an `id` of `components-reconnect-modal` in the `<body>` of the `_Host.cshtml` Razor page:

```cshtml
<div id="components-reconnect-modal">
    ...
</div>
```

Add the following to the app's stylesheet (`wwwroot/css/app.css` or `wwwroot/css/site.css`):

```css
#components-reconnect-modal {
    display: none;
}

#components-reconnect-modal.components-reconnect-show {
    display: block;
}
```

The following table describes the CSS classes applied to the `components-reconnect-modal` element.

| CSS class                       | Indicates&hellip; |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `components-reconnect-show`     | A lost connection. The client is attempting to reconnect. Show the modal. |
| `components-reconnect-hide`     | An active connection is re-established to the server. Hide the modal. |
| `components-reconnect-failed`   | Reconnection failed, probably due to a network failure. To attempt reconnection, call `window.Blazor.reconnect()`. |
| `components-reconnect-rejected` | Reconnection rejected. The server was reached but refused the connection, and the user's state on the server is lost. To reload the app, call `location.reload()`. This connection state may result when:<ul><li>A crash in the server-side circuit occurs.</li><li>The client is disconnected long enough for the server to drop the user's state. Instances of the components that the user is interacting with are disposed.</li><li>The server is restarted, or the app's worker process is recycled.</li></ul> |

## Render mode

*This section applies to Blazor Server.*

Blazor Server apps are set up by default to prerender the UI on the server before the client connection to the server is established. This is set up in the `_Host.cshtml` Razor page:

```cshtml
<body>
    <app>
      <component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
    </app>

    <script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
</body>
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers.ComponentTagHelper.RenderMode> configures whether the component:

* Is prerendered into the page.
* Is rendered as static HTML on the page or if it includes the necessary information to bootstrap a Blazor app from the user agent.

| Render mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.ServerPrerendered> | Renders the component into static HTML and includes a marker for a Blazor Server app. When the user-agent starts, this marker is used to bootstrap a Blazor app. |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.Server> | Renders a marker for a Blazor Server app. Output from the component isn't included. When the user-agent starts, this marker is used to bootstrap a Blazor app. |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering.RenderMode.Static> | Renders the component into static HTML. |

Rendering server components from a static HTML page isn't supported.

## Initialize the Blazor circuit

*This section applies to Blazor Server.*

Configure the manual start of a Blazor Server app's [SignalR circuit](xref:blazor/hosting-models#circuits) in the `Pages/_Host.cshtml` file:

* Add an `autostart="false"` attribute to the `<script>` tag for the `blazor.server.js` script.
* Place a script that calls `Blazor.start` after the `blazor.server.js` script's tag and inside the closing `</body>` tag.

When `autostart` is disabled, any aspect of the app that doesn't depend on the circuit works normally. For example, client-side routing is operational. However, any aspect that depends on the circuit isn't operational until `Blazor.start` is called. App behavior is unpredictable without an established circuit. For example, component methods fail to execute while the circuit is disconnected.

### Initialize Blazor when the document is ready

To initialize the Blazor app when the document is ready:

```cshtml
<body>

    ...

    <script autostart="false" src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        Blazor.start();
      });
    </script>
</body>
```

### Chain to the `Promise` that results from a manual start

To perform additional tasks, such as JS interop initialization, use `then` to chain to the `Promise` that results from a manual Blazor app start:

```cshtml
<body>

    ...

    <script autostart="false" src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
    <script>
      Blazor.start().then(function () {
        ...
      });
    </script>
</body>
```

### Configure the SignalR client

#### Logging

To configure SignalR client logging, pass in a configuration object (`configureSignalR`) that calls `configureLogging` with the log level on the client builder:

```cshtml
<body>

    ...

    <script autostart="false" src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
    <script>
      Blazor.start({
        configureSignalR: function (builder) {
          builder.configureLogging("information");
        }
      });
    </script>
</body>
```

In the preceding example, `information` is equivalent to a log level of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.Information?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

### Modify the reconnection handler

The reconnection handler's circuit connection events can be modified for custom behaviors, such as:

* To notify the user if the connection is dropped.
* To perform logging (from the client) when a circuit is connected.

To modify the connection events, register callbacks for the following connection changes:

* Dropped connections use `onConnectionDown`.
* Established/re-established connections use `onConnectionUp`.

**Both** `onConnectionDown` and `onConnectionUp` must be specified:

```cshtml
<body>

    ...

    <script autostart="false" src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
    <script>
      Blazor.start({
        reconnectionHandler: {
          onConnectionDown: (options, error) => console.error(error);
          onConnectionUp: () => console.log("Up, up, and away!");
        }
      });
    </script>
</body>
```

### Adjust the reconnection retry count and interval

To adjust the reconnection retry count and interval, set the number of retries (`maxRetries`) and period in milliseconds permitted for each retry attempt (`retryIntervalMilliseconds`):

```cshtml
<body>

    ...

    <script autostart="false" src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
    <script>
      Blazor.start({
        reconnectionOptions: {
          maxRetries: 3,
          retryIntervalMilliseconds: 2000
        }
      });
    </script>
</body>
```

## Hide or replace the reconnection display

To hide the reconnection display, set the reconnection handler's `_reconnectionDisplay` to an empty object (`{}` or `new Object()`):

```cshtml
<body>

    ...

    <script autostart="false" src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function () {
        Blazor.defaultReconnectionHandler._reconnectionDisplay = {};
      });

      Blazor.start();
    </script>
</body>
```

To replace the reconnection display, set `_reconnectionDisplay` in the preceding example to the element for display:

```javascript
Blazor.defaultReconnectionHandler._reconnectionDisplay = 
  document.getElementById("{ELEMENT ID}");
```

The placeholder `{ELEMENT ID}` is the ID of the HTML element to display.

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-5.0"

Customize the delay before the reconnection display appears by setting the `transition-delay` property in the app's CSS (`wwwroot/css/site.css`) for the modal element. The following example sets the transition delay from 500 ms (default) to 1,000 ms (1 second):

```css
#components-reconnect-modal {
    transition: visibility 0s linear 1000ms;
}
```

## Disconnect the Blazor circuit from the client

By default, a Blazor circuit is disconnected when the [`unload` page event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/unload_event) is triggered. To disconnect the circuit for other scenarios on the client, invoke `Blazor.disconnect` in the appropriate event handler. In the following example, the circuit is disconnected when the page is hidden ([`pagehide` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/pagehide_event)):

```javascript
window.addEventListener('pagehide', () => {
  Blazor.disconnect();
});
```

## Influence HTML `<head>` tag elements

*This section applies to the upcoming ASP.NET Core 5.0 release of Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server.*

When rendered, the `Title`, `Link`, and `Meta` components add or update data in the HTML `<head>` tag elements:

```razor
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.Extensions.Head

<Title Value="{TITLE}" />
<Link href="{URL}" rel="stylesheet" />
<Meta content="{DESCRIPTION}" name="description" />
```

In the preceding example, placeholders for `{TITLE}`, `{URL}`, and `{DESCRIPTION}` are string values, Razor variables, or Razor expressions.

The following characteristics apply:

* Server-side prerendering is supported.
* The `Value` parameter is the only valid parameter for the `Title` component.
* HTML attributes provided to the `Meta` and `Link` components are captured in [additional attributes](xref:blazor/components/index#attribute-splatting-and-arbitrary-parameters) and passed through to the rendered HTML tag.
* For multiple `Title` components, the title of the page reflects the `Value` of the last `Title` component rendered.
* If multiple `Meta` or `Link` components are included with identical attributes, there's exactly one HTML tag rendered per `Meta` or `Link` component. Two `Meta` or `Link` components can't refer to the same rendered HTML tag.
* Changes to the parameters of existing `Meta` or `Link` components are reflected in their rendered HTML tags.
* When the `Link` or `Meta` components are no longer rendered and thus disposed by the framework, their rendered HTML tags are removed.

When one of the framework components is used in a child component, the rendered HTML tag influences any other child component of the parent component as long as the child component containing the framework component is rendered. The distinction between using the one of these framework components in a child component and placing a an HTML tag in `wwwroot/index.html` or `Pages/_Host.cshtml` is that a framework component's rendered HTML tag:

* Can be modified by application state. A hard-coded HTML tag can't be modified by application state.
* Is removed from the HTML `<head>` when the parent component is no longer rendered.

## Static files

*This section applies to Blazor Server.*

To create additional file mappings with a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles.FileExtensionContentTypeProvider> or configure other <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StaticFileOptions>, use **one** of the following approaches. In the following examples, the `{EXTENSION}` placeholder is the file extension, and the `{CONTENT TYPE}` placeholder is the content type.

* Configure options through [dependency injection (DI)](xref:blazor/fundamentals/dependency-injection) in `Startup.ConfigureServices` (`Startup.cs`) using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StaticFileOptions>:

  ```csharp
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles;

  ...

  var provider = new FileExtensionContentTypeProvider();
  provider.Mappings["{EXTENSION}"] = "{CONTENT TYPE}";

  services.Configure<StaticFileOptions>(options =>
  {
      options.ContentTypeProvider = provider;
  });
  ```

  Because this approach configures the same file provider used to serve `blazor.server.js`, make sure that your custom configuration doesn't interfere with serving `blazor.server.js`. For example, don't remove the mapping for JavaScript files by configuring the provider with `provider.Mappings.Remove(".js")`.

* Use two calls to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StaticFileExtensions.UseStaticFiles%2A> in `Startup.Configure` (`Startup.cs`):
  * Configure the custom file provider in the first call with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StaticFileOptions>.
  * The second middleware serves `blazor.server.js`, which uses the default static files configuration provided by the Blazor framework.

  ```csharp
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles;

  ...

  var provider = new FileExtensionContentTypeProvider();
  provider.Mappings["{EXTENSION}"] = "{CONTENT TYPE}";

  app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions { ContentTypeProvider = provider });
  app.UseStaticFiles();
  ```

* You can avoid interfering with serving `_framework/blazor.server.js` by using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.MapWhenExtensions.MapWhen%2A> to execute a custom Static File Middleware:

  ```csharp
  app.MapWhen(ctx => !ctx.Request.Path
      .StartsWithSegments("_framework/blazor.server.js", 
          subApp => subApp.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions(){ ... })));
  ```
