# Handle errors in ASP.NET Core

By [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra/), [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex), and [Steve Smith](https://ardalis.com/)

This article covers common approaches to handling errors in ASP.NET Core apps.

## Developer Exception Page

To configure an app to display a page that shows detailed information about request exceptions, use the *Developer Exception Page*. The page is made available by the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics/) package, which is available in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage-app). Add a line to the `Startup.Configure` method when the app is running in the Development [environment](xref:fundamentals/environments):

[!code-csharp[](error-handling/samples/2.x/ErrorHandlingSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_UseDeveloperExceptionPage)]

Place the call to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.DeveloperExceptionPageExtensions.UseDeveloperExceptionPage*> in front of any middleware where you want to catch exceptions.

> [!WARNING]
> Enable the Developer Exception Page **only when the app is running in the Development environment**. You don't want to share detailed exception information publicly when the app runs in production. For more information on configuring environments, see <xref:fundamentals/environments>.

To see the Developer Exception Page, run the sample app with the environment set to `Development` and add `?throw=true` to the base URL of the app. The page includes the following information about the exception and the request:

* Stack trace
* Query string parameters (if any)
* Cookies (if any)
* Headers

## Configure a custom exception handling page

When the app isn't running in the Development environment, call the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ExceptionHandlerExtensions.UseExceptionHandler*> extension method to add Exception Handling Middleware. The middleware:

* Catches exceptions.
* Logs exceptions.
* Re-executes the request in an alternate pipeline for the page or controller indicated. The request isn't re-executed if the response has started.

In the following example from the sample app, <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ExceptionHandlerExtensions.UseExceptionHandler*> adds the Exception Handling Middleware in non-Development environments. The extension method specifies an error page or controller at the `/Error` endpoint for re-executed requests after exceptions are caught and logged:

[!code-csharp[](error-handling/samples/2.x/ErrorHandlingSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_UseExceptionHandler1)]

The Razor Pages app template provides an Error page (*.cshtml*) and <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages.PageModel> class (`ErrorModel`) in the Pages folder.

In an MVC app, the following error handler method is included in the MVC app template and appears in the Home controller:

```csharp
[AllowAnonymous]
public IActionResult Error()
{
    return View(new ErrorViewModel 
        { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
}
```

Don't decorate the error handler action method with HTTP method attributes, such as `HttpGet`. Explicit verbs prevent some requests from reaching the method. Allow anonymous access to the method so that unauthenticated users are able to receive the error view.

## Access the exception

Use <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandlerPathFeature> to access the exception or the original request path in a controller or page:

* The path is available from the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandlerPathFeature.Path> property.
* Read the <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName> from the inherited [IExceptionHandlerFeature.Error](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandlerFeature.Error) property.

```csharp
// using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics;

var exceptionHandlerPathFeature = 
    HttpContext.Features.Get<IExceptionHandlerPathFeature>();
var path = exceptionHandlerPathFeature?.Path;
var error = exceptionHandlerPathFeature?.Error;
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** serve sensitive error information from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandlerFeature> or <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandlerPathFeature> to clients. Serving errors is a security risk.

## Configure custom exception handling code

An alternative to serving an endpoint for errors with a [custom exception handling page](#configure-a-custom-exception-handling-page) is to provide a lambda to <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ExceptionHandlerExtensions.UseExceptionHandler*>. Using a lambda with <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ExceptionHandlerExtensions.UseExceptionHandler*> allows access to the error before returning the response.

The sample app demonstrates custom exception handling code in `Startup.Configure`. Trigger an exception with the **Throw Exception** link on the Index page. The following lambda runs:

[!code-csharp[](error-handling/samples/2.x/ErrorHandlingSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_UseExceptionHandler2)]

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** serve sensitive error information from <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandlerFeature> or <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IExceptionHandlerPathFeature> to clients. Serving errors is a security risk.

## Configure status code pages

By default, an ASP.NET Core app doesn't provide a status code page for HTTP status codes, such as *404 - Not Found*. The app returns a status code and an empty response body. To provide status code pages, use Status Code Pages Middleware.

The middleware is made available by the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics/) package, which is available in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage](xref:fundamentals/metapackage-app).

Add a line to the `Startup.Configure` method:

```csharp
app.UseStatusCodePages();
```

Call the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePages*> method before request handling middleware (for example, Static File Middleware and MVC Middleware).

By default, Status Code Pages Middleware adds text-only handlers for common status codes, such as *404 - Not Found*:

```
Status Code: 404; Not Found
```

The middleware supports several extension methods that allow you to customize its behavior.

An overload of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePages*> takes a lambda expression, which you can use to process custom error-handling logic and manually write the response:

[!code-csharp[](error-handling/samples/2.x/ErrorHandlingSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_StatusCodePages)]

An overload of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePages*> takes a content type and format string, which you can use to customize the content type and response text:

```csharp
app.UseStatusCodePages("text/plain", "Status code page, status code: {0}");
```

### Redirect and re-execute extension methods

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects*>:

* Sends a *302 - Found* status code to the client.
* Redirects the client to the location provided in the URL template.

[!code-csharp[](error-handling/samples/2.x/ErrorHandlingSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_StatusCodePagesWithRedirect)]

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects*> is commonly used when the app:

* Should redirect the client to a different endpoint, usually in cases where a different app processes the error. For web apps, the client's browser address bar reflects the redirected endpoint.
* Shouldn't preserve and return the original status code with the initial redirect response.

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute*>:

* Returns the original status code to the client.
* Generates the response body by re-executing the request pipeline using an alternate path.

```csharp
app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute("/Error/{0}");
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute*> is commonly used when the app should:

* Process the request without redirecting to a different endpoint. For web apps, the client's browser address bar reflects the originally requested endpoint.
* Preserve and return the original status code with the response.

Templates may include a placeholder (`{0}`) for the status code. The template must start with a forward slash (`/`). When using a placeholder, confirm that the endpoint (page or controller) can process the path segment. For example, a Razor Page for errors should accept the optional path segment value with the `@page` directive:

```cshtml
@page "{code?}"
```

Status code pages can be disabled for specific requests in a Razor Pages handler method or in an MVC controller. To disable status code pages, attempt to retrieve the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.IStatusCodePagesFeature> from the request's [HttpContext.Features](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext.Features) collection and disable the feature if it's available:

```csharp
var statusCodePagesFeature = HttpContext.Features.Get<IStatusCodePagesFeature>();

if (statusCodePagesFeature != null)
{
    statusCodePagesFeature.Enabled = false;
}
```

To use a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StatusCodePagesExtensions.UseStatusCodePages*> overload that points to an endpoint within the app, create an MVC view or Razor Page for the endpoint. For example, the Razor Pages app template produces the following page and page model class:

*Error.cshtml*:

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.2"

```cshtml
@page
@model ErrorModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Error";
}

<h1 class="text-danger">Error.</h1>
<h2 class="text-danger">An error occurred while processing your request.</h2>

@if (Model.ShowRequestId)
{
    <p>
        <strong>Request ID:</strong> <code>@Model.RequestId</code>
    </p>
}

<h3>Development Mode</h3>
<p>
    Swapping to the <strong>Development</strong> environment displays 
    detailed information about the error that occurred.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Development environment shouldn't be enabled for deployed 
    applications.</strong> It can result in displaying sensitive information 
    from exceptions to end users. For local debugging, enable the 
    <strong>Development</strong> environment by setting the 
    <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</strong> environment variable to 
    <strong>Development</strong> and restarting the app.
</p>
```

*Error.cshtml.cs*:

```csharp
[ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
public class ErrorModel : PageModel
{
    public string RequestId { get; set; }

    public bool ShowRequestId => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(RequestId);

    public void OnGet()
    {
        RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier;
    }
}
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.2"

```cshtml
@page
@model ErrorModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Error";
}

<h1 class="text-danger">Error.</h1>
<h2 class="text-danger">An error occurred while processing your request.</h2>

@if (Model.ShowRequestId)
{
    <p>
        <strong>Request ID:</strong> <code>@Model.RequestId</code>
    </p>
}

<h3>Development Mode</h3>
<p>
    Swapping to <strong>Development</strong> environment will display more detailed 
    information about the error that occurred.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Development environment should not be enabled in deployed applications
    </strong>, as it can result in sensitive information from exceptions being 
    displayed to end users. For local debugging, development environment can be 
    enabled by setting the <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</strong> environment 
    variable to <strong>Development</strong>, and restarting the application.
</p>
```

*Error.cshtml.cs*:

```csharp
public class ErrorModel : PageModel
{
    public string RequestId { get; set; }

    public bool ShowRequestId => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(RequestId);

    [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, 
        NoStore = true)]
    public void OnGet()
    {
        RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier;
    }
}
```

## Exception-handling code

Code in exception handling pages can throw exceptions. It's often a good idea for production error pages to consist of purely static content.

Also, be aware that once the headers for a response are sent:

* The app can't change the response's status code.
* Any exception pages or handlers can't run. The response must be completed or the connection aborted.

## Server exception handling

In addition to the exception handling logic in your app, the [server implementation](xref:fundamentals/servers/index) can handle some exceptions. If the server catches an exception before response headers are sent, the server sends a *500 - Internal Server Error* response without a response body. If the server catches an exception after response headers are sent, the server closes the connection. Requests that aren't handled by your app are handled by the server. Any exception that occurs when the server is handling the request is handled by the server's exception handling. The app's custom error pages, exception handling middleware, and filters don't affect this behavior.

## Startup exception handling

Only the hosting layer can handle exceptions that take place during app startup. Using [Web Host](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host), you can [configure how the host behaves in response to errors during startup](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#detailed-errors) with the `captureStartupErrors` and `detailedErrors` keys.

Hosting can only show an error page for a captured startup error if the error occurs after host address/port binding. If any binding fails for any reason:

* The hosting layer logs a critical exception.
* The dotnet process crashes.
* No error page is displayed when the app is running on the [Kestrel](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel) server.

When running on [IIS](/iis) or [IIS Express](/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview), a *502.5 - Process Failure* is returned by the [ASP.NET Core Module](xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module) if the process can't start. For more information, see <xref:host-and-deploy/iis/troubleshoot>. For information on troubleshooting startup issues with Azure App Service, see <xref:host-and-deploy/azure-apps/troubleshoot>.

## ASP.NET Core MVC error handling

[MVC](xref:mvc/overview) apps have some additional options for handling errors, such as configuring exception filters and performing model validation.

### Exception filters

Exception filters can be configured globally or on a per-controller or per-action basis in an MVC app. These filters handle any unhandled exception that occurs during the execution of a controller action or another filter. These filters aren't called otherwise. For more information, see <xref:mvc/controllers/filters#exception-filters>.

> [!TIP]
> Exception filters are useful for trapping exceptions that occur within MVC actions, but they're not as flexible as the Exception Handling Middleware. We recommend using the middleware. Use filters only where you need to perform error handling *differently* based on which MVC action is chosen.

### Handle model state errors

[Model validation](xref:mvc/models/validation) occurs prior to invoking each controller action, and it's the action method's responsibility to inspect [ModelState.IsValid](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding.ModelStateDictionary.IsValid) and react appropriately.

Some apps choose to follow a standard convention for dealing with [model validation](xref:mvc/models/validation) errors, in which case a [filter](xref:mvc/controllers/filters) may be an appropriate place to implement such a policy. You should test how your actions behave with invalid model states. For more information, see <xref:mvc/controllers/testing>.
