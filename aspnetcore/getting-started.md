# Getting Started with ASP.NET Core

1.  Install [.NET Core](https://microsoft.com/net/core)

2.  Create a new .NET Core project:

    ```console
    mkdir aspnetcoreapp
    cd aspnetcoreapp
    dotnet new -t web
    ```

3.  Restore the packages:

    ```console
    dotnet restore
    ```

4.  Run the app  (the `dotnet run` command will build the app when it's out of date):

    ```console
    dotnet run
    ```

5.  Browse to `http://localhost:5000`
