# Host and deploy Blazor server-side

By [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex), [Rainer Stropek](https://www.timecockpit.com), and [Daniel Roth](https://github.com/danroth27)

## Host configuration values

Server-side apps that use the [server-side hosting model](xref:blazor/hosting-models#server-side) can accept [Generic Host configuration values](xref:fundamentals/host/generic-host#host-configuration).

## Deployment

With the [server-side hosting model](xref:blazor/hosting-models#server-side), Blazor is executed on the server from within an ASP.NET Core app. UI updates, event handling, and JavaScript calls are handled over a [SignalR](xref:signalr/introduction) connection.

The app is included with the ASP.NET Core app in the published output, and the two apps are deployed together. A web server that's capable of hosting an ASP.NET Core app is required. For a server-side deployment, Visual Studio includes the **Blazor (server-side)** project template (`blazorserverside` template when using the [dotnet new](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command).
