The `FetchData` component shows how to:

* Provision an access token.
* Use the access token to call a protected resource API in the *Server* app.

The `@attribute [Authorize]` directive indicates to the Blazor WebAssembly authorization system that the user must be authorized in order to visit this component. The presence of the attribute in the *Client* app doesn't prevent the API on the server from being called without proper credentials. The *Server* app also must use `[Authorize]` on the appropriate endpoints to correctly protect them.

`AuthenticationService.RequestAccessToken();` takes care of requesting an access token that can be added to the request to call the API. If the token is cached or the service is able to provision a new access token without user interaction, the token request succeeds. Otherwise, the token request fails.

In order to obtain the actual token to include in the request, the app must check that the request succeeded by calling `tokenResult.TryGetToken(out var token)`. 

If the request was successful, the token variable is populated with the access token. The `Value` property of the token exposes the literal string to include in the `Authorization` request header.

If the request failed because the token couldn't be provisioned without user interaction, the token result contains a redirect URL. Navigating to this URL takes the user to the login page and back to the current page after a successful authentication.

```razor
@page "/fetchdata"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication
@inject IAccessTokenProvider AuthenticationService
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@using {APPLICATION NAMESPACE}.Shared
@attribute [Authorize]

...

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[] forecasts;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(Navigation.BaseUri);

        var tokenResult = await AuthenticationService.RequestAccessToken();

        if (tokenResult.TryGetToken(out var token))
        {
            httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", 
                $"Bearer {token.Value}");
            forecasts = await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>(
                "WeatherForecast");
        }
        else
        {
            Navigation.NavigateTo(tokenResult.RedirectUrl);
        }

    }
}
```
