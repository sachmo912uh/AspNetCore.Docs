This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC web development with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a feature of the ASP.NET Core MVC framework that makes building and testing web UI easier and more productive. You can use Razor pages alongside controllers and views in the same project.

We recommend you try the [Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start) tutorial before the MVC/Controller/Views version. The Razor Pages tutorial:

* Is the preferred approach for new application development.
* Is easier to follow.
* Covers more features.

If you choose this tutorial over the [Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start) version, let us know why in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/issues/6146).
