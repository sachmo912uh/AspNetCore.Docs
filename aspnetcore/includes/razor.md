This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a new alternative in ASP.NET Core 2.0, a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. We recommend you try the Razor Pages tutorial before the MVC version. For a Razor Pages version of this tutorial, see [Razor Pages](xref:mvc/razor-pages/index).
