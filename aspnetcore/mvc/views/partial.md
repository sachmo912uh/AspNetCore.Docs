# Partial views in ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core supports partial views. Partial views are used to share reusable parts of web pages across different views.

## What are partial views

A partial view is a view that's rendered within another view. The HTML output generated by executing the partial view is rendered into the calling (or parent) view. Like views, partial views use the *.cshtml* file extension.

For example, the ASP.NET Core 2.1 **Web Application** project template includes a *_CookieConsentPartial.cshtml* partial view. The partial view is loaded from within *_Layout.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml?name=snippet_CookieConsentPartial)]

## When to use partial views

Partial views are an effective way of breaking up large views into smaller components. They can reduce duplication of view content and allow view elements to be reused. Common layout elements should be specified in [_Layout.cshtml](xref:mvc/views/layout). Non-layout reusable content can be encapsulated into partial views.

In a complex page composed of several logical pieces, it's helpful to work with each piece as its own partial view. Each piece of the page can be viewed in isolation from the rest of the page. The view for the page itself becomes simpler, since it only contains the overall page structure and calls to render the partial views.

ASP.NET Core MVC controllers have a [PartialView](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.controller.partialview#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Mvc_Controller_PartialView) method which is called from an action method. Razor Pages have no equivalent `PartialView` method.

## Declare partial views

Partial views are created like a regular view&mdash;by creating a *.cshtml* file within the *Views* folder. There's no semantic difference between a partial view and a regular view; however, they're rendered differently. You can have a view that's returned directly from a controller's [ViewResult](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.viewresult), and the same view can be used as a partial view. The main difference between how a view and a partial view are rendered is that partial views don't run *_ViewStart.cshtml*. Regular views do run *_ViewStart.cshtml*. Learn more about *_ViewStart.cshtml* in [Layout](xref:mvc/views/layout)).

As a convention, partial view file names often begin with `_`. This naming convention isn't a requirement, but it helps to visually differentiate partial views from regular views.

## Reference a partial view

Within a view page, there are several ways to render a partial view. The best practice is to use asynchronous rendering.

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

### Partial Tag Helper

The Partial Tag Helper requires ASP.NET Core 2.1 or later. It renders asynchronously and uses an HTML-like syntax:

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Home/Discovery.cshtml?name=snippet_PartialTagHelper)]

For more information, see <xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/partial-tag-helper>.

::: moniker-end

### Asynchronous HTML Helper

When using an HTML Helper, the best practice is to use [PartialAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.partialasync#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Mvc_Rendering_HtmlHelperPartialExtensions_PartialAsync_Microsoft_AspNetCore_Mvc_Rendering_IHtmlHelper_System_String_). It returns an [IHtmlContent](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.html.ihtmlcontent) type wrapped in a `Task`. The method is referenced by prefixing the call with `@`:

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Home/Discovery.cshtml?name=snippet_PartialAsync)]

Alternatively, you can render a partial view with [RenderPartialAsync](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.renderpartialasync). This method doesn't return a result. It streams the rendered output directly to the response. Because the method doesn't return a result, it must be called within a Razor code block:

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Home/Discovery.cshtml?name=snippet_RenderPartialAsync)]

Since it streams the result directly, `RenderPartialAsync` may perform better in some scenarios. However, it's recommended that you use `PartialAsync`.

### Synchronous HTML Helper

[Partial](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.partial) and [RenderPartial](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.htmlhelperpartialextensions.renderpartial) are the synchronous equivalents of `PartialAsync` and `RenderPartialAsync`, respectively. Use of the synchronous equivalents isn't recommended because there are scenarios in which they deadlock. Future releases won't contain the synchronous methods.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your views need to execute code, use a [view component](xref:mvc/views/view-components) instead of a partial view.

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

In ASP.NET Core 2.1 or later, calling `Partial` or `RenderPartial` results in an analyzer warning. For example, usage of `Partial` yields the following warning message:

> Use of IHtmlHelper.Partial may result in application deadlocks. Consider using `<partial>` Tag Helper or `IHtmlHelper.PartialAsync`.

Replace calls to `@Html.Partial` with `@await Html.PartialAsync` or the Partial Tag Helper. For more information on Partial Tag Helper migration, see [Migrate from an HTML Helper](xref:mvc/views/tag-helpers/builtin-th/partial-tag-helper#migrate-from-an-html-helper).

## Partial view discovery

When referencing a partial view, you can refer to its location in several ways. For example:

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

```cshtml
// Uses a view in current folder with this name.
// If none is found, searches the Shared folder.
<partial name="_ViewName" />

// A view with this name must be in the same folder
<partial name="_ViewName.cshtml" />

// Locate the view based on the app root.
// Paths that start with "/" or "~/" refer to the app root.
<partial name="~/Views/Folder/_ViewName.cshtml" />
<partial name="/Views/Folder/_ViewName.cshtml" />

// Locate the view using a relative path
<partial name="../Account/_LoginPartial.cshtml" />
```

The preceding example uses the Partial Tag Helper, which requires ASP.NET Core 2.1 or later. The following example uses asynchronous HTML Helpers to accomplish the same task.

::: moniker-end

```cshtml
// Uses a view in current folder with this name.
// If none is found, searches the Shared folder.
@await Html.PartialAsync("_ViewName")

// A view with this name must be in the same folder
@await Html.PartialAsync("_ViewName.cshtml")

// Locate the view based on the app root.
// Paths that start with "/" or "~/" refer to the app root.
@await Html.PartialAsync("~/Views/Folder/_ViewName.cshtml")
@await Html.PartialAsync("/Views/Folder/_ViewName.cshtml")

// Locate the view using a relative path
@await Html.PartialAsync("../Account/_LoginPartial.cshtml")
```

You can have different partial views with the same file name in different view folders. When referencing the views by name (without a file extension), views in each folder use the partial view in the same folder with them. You can also specify a default partial view to use, placing it in the *Shared* folder. The shared partial view is used by any views that don't have their own version of the partial view. You can have a default partial view (in *Shared*), which is overridden by a partial view with the same name in the same folder as the parent view.

Partial views can be *chained*&mdash;a partial view can call another partial view (as long as you don't create a loop). Within each view or partial view, relative paths are always relative to that view, not to the root or parent view.

> [!NOTE]
> A [Razor](xref:mvc/views/razor) `section` defined in a partial view is invisible to parents views. The `section` is only visible to the partial view in which it's defined.

## Access data from partial views

When a partial view is instantiated, it gets a copy of the parent view's `ViewData` dictionary. Updates made to the data within the partial view aren't persisted to the parent view. `ViewData` changes in a partial view are lost when the partial view returns.

You can pass an instance of [ViewDataDictionary](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.viewfeatures.viewdatadictionary) to the partial view:

```cshtml
@await Html.PartialAsync("_PartialName", customViewData)
```

You can pass a model into a partial view. The model can be the page's view model or a custom object. You can pass a model to `PartialAsync` or `RenderPartialAsync`:

```cshtml
@await Html.PartialAsync("_PartialName", viewModel)
```

You can pass an instance of `ViewDataDictionary` and a view model to a partial view:

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Articles/Read.cshtml?name=snippet_PartialAsync)]

The following markup shows the *Views/Articles/Read.cshtml* view, which contains two partial views. The second partial view passes in a model and `ViewData` to the partial view. Use the highlighted `ViewDataDictionary` constructor overload to pass a new `ViewData` dictionary while retaining the existing `ViewData` dictionary.

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Articles/Read.cshtml?name=snippet_ReadPartialView&highlight=17-20)]

*Views/Shared/_AuthorPartial*:

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Shared/_AuthorPartial.cshtml)]

The *_ArticleSection* partial:

[!code-cshtml[](partial/sample/PartialViewsSample/Views/Articles/_ArticleSection.cshtml)]

At runtime, the partials are rendered into the parent view, which itself is rendered within the shared *_Layout.cshtml*.
