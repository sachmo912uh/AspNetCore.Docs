# Response compression sample application

This sample illustrates the use of ASP.NET Core Response Compression Middleware to compress HTTP responses. The sample demonstrates Gzip and custom compression providers for text and image responses and shows how to add a MIME type for compression.

## Examples in this sample
* `GzipCompressionProvider`
  * `text/plain`
    * **/** - Lorem Ipsum text file response at 2,044 bytes that will compress to 927 bytes
    * **/testfile1kb.txt** - Text file response at 1,033 bytes that will compress to 47 bytes
    * **/trickle** - Response issued as single characters at 1 second intervals 
  * `image/svg+xml`
    * **/banner.svg** - A Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image response at 9,707 bytes that will compress to 4,459 bytes
* `CustomCompressionProvider`<br>Shows how to implement a custom compression provider for use with the middleware

When the request includes the `Accept-Encoding` header, the sample adds a `Vary: Accept-Encoding` header to the response. The `Vary` header instructs caches to maintain multiple copies of the response based on alternative values of `Accept-Encoding`, so both a compressed (gzip) and uncompressed version will be stored in caches for systems that can either accept the compressed or the uncompressed response.

## Using the sample
1. Make a request using [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler), [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/), or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to the application without an `Accept-Encoding` header and note the response payload, response size, and response headers.
2. Add an `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header and note the compressed response size and response headers. You will see the response size drop and the `Content-Encoding: gzip` response header. When you look at the response body for the Lorem Ipsum or **testfile1kb.txt** response, you will see that the text has been compressed and is unreadable.
3. Add an `Accept-Encoding: mycustomcompression` header and note the response headers. The `CustomCompressionProvider` is an empty implementation that doesn't actually compress the response, but you can create a custom compression stream wrapper for the `CreateStream()` method.
