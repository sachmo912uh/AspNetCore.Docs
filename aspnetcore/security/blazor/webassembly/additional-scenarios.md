## Request additional access tokens

Most apps only require an access token to interact with the protected resources that they use. In some scenarios, an app might require more than one token in order to interact with two or more resources.

In the following example, additional Azure Active Directory (AAD) Microsoft Graph API scopes are required by an app to read user data and send mail. After adding the Microsoft Graph API permissions in the Azure AAD portal, the additional scopes are configured in the Client app (`Program.Main`, *Program.cs*):

```csharp
builder.Services.AddMsalAuthentication(options =>
{
    ...

    options.ProviderOptions.AdditionalScopesToConsent.Add(
        "https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send");
    options.ProviderOptions.AdditionalScopesToConsent.Add(
        "https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read");
}
```

The `IAccessTokenProvider.RequestToken` method provides an overload that allows an app to provision a token with a given set of scopes, as seen in the following example:

```csharp
var tokenResult = await AuthenticationService.RequestAccessToken(
    new AccessTokenRequestOptions
    {
        Scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send", 
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read" }
    });

if (tokenResult.TryGetToken(out var token))
{
    ...
}
```

`TryGetToken` returns:

* `true` with the `token` for use.
* `false` if the token isn't retrieved.

## Handle token request errors

When a Single Page Application (SPA) authenticates a user using Open ID Connect (OIDC), the authentication state is maintained locally within the SPA and in the Identity Provider (IP) in the form of a session cookie that's set as a result of the user providing their credentials.

The tokens that the IP emits for the user typically are valid for short periods of time, about one hour normally, so the client app must regularly fetch new tokens. Otherwise, the user would be logged-out after the granted tokens expire. In most cases, OIDC clients are able to provision new tokens without requiring the user to authenticate again thanks to the authentication state or "session" that is kept within the IP.

There are some cases in which the client can't get a token without user interaction, for example, when for some reason the user explicitly logs out from the IP. This scenario occurs if a user visits `https://login.microsoftonline.com` and logs out. In these scenarios, the app doesn't know immediately that the user has logged out. Any token that the client holds might no longer be valid. Also, the client isn't able to provision a new token without user interaction after the current token expires.

These scenarios aren't specific to token-based authentication. They are part of the nature of SPAs. An SPA using cookies also fails to call a server API if the authentication cookie is removed.

When an app performs API calls to protected resources, you must be aware of the following:

* To provision a new access token to call the API, the user might be required to authenticate again.
* Even if the client has a token that seems to be valid, the call to the server might fail because the token was revoked by the user.

When the app requests a token, there are two possible outcomes:

* The request succeeds, and the app has a valid token.
* The request fails, and the app must authenticate the user again to obtain a new token.

When a token request fails, you need to decide whether you want to save any current state before you perform a redirection. Several approaches exist with increasing levels of complexity:

* Store the current page state in session storage. During `OnInitializeAsync`, check if state can be restored before continuing.
* Add a query string parameter and use that as a way to signal the app that it needs to re-hydrate the previously saved state.
* Add a query string parameter with a unique identifier to store data in session storage without risking collisions with other items.

The following example shows how to:

* Preserve state before redirecting to the login page.
* Recover the previous state afterward authentication using the query string parameter.

```razor
<EditForm Model="User" @onsubmit="OnSaveAsync">
    <label>User
        <InputText @bind-Value="User.Name" />
    </label>
    <label>Last name
        <InputText @bind-Value="User.LastName" />
    </label>
</EditForm>

@code {
    public class Profile
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
    }

    public Profile User { get; set; } = new Profile();

    protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var currentQuery = new Uri(Navigation.Uri).Query;

        if (currentQuery.Contains("state=resumeSavingProfile"))
        {
            User = await JS.InvokeAsync<Profile>("sessionStorage.getState", 
                "resumeSavingProfile");
        }
    }

    public async Task OnSaveAsync()
    {
        var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(Navigation.BaseUri);

        var resumeUri = Navigation.Uri + $"?state=resumeSavingProfile";

        var tokenResult = await AuthenticationService.RequestAccessToken(
            new AccessTokenRequestOptions
            {
                ReturnUrl = resumeUri
            });

        if (tokenResult.TryGetToken(out var token))
        {
            httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", 
                $"Bearer {token.Value}");
            await httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync("Save", User);
        }
        else
        {
            await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("sessionStorage.setState", 
                "resumeSavingProfile", User);
            Navigation.NavigateTo(tokenResult.RedirectUrl);
        }
    }
}
```

## Save app state before an authentication operation

During an authentication operation, there are cases where you want to save the app state before the browser is redirected to the IP. This can be the case when you are using something like a state container and you want to restore the state after the authentication succeeds. You can use a custom authentication state object to preserve app-specific state or a reference to it and restore that state once the authentication operation successfully completes.

`Authentication` component (*Pages/Authentication.razor*):

```razor
@page "/authentication/{action}"
@inject JSRuntime JS
@inject StateContainer State
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication

<RemoteAuthenticatorViewCore Action="@Action" 
    AuthenticationState="AuthenticationState" OnLoginSucceded="RestoreState" 
    OnLogoutSucceded="RestoreState" />

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string Action { get; set; }

    public class ApplicationAuthenticationState : RemoteAuthenticationState
    {
        public string Id { get; set; }
    }

    protected async override Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        if (RemoteAuthenticationActions.IsAction(RemoteAuthenticationActions.LogIn, 
            Action))
        {
            AuthenticationState.Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
            await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("sessionStorage.setKey", 
                AuthenticationState.Id, State.Store());
        }
    }

    public async Task RestoreState(ApplicationAuthenticationState state)
    {
        var stored = await JS.InvokeAsync<string>("sessionStorage.getKey", 
            state.Id);
        State.FromStore(stored);
    }

    public ApplicationAuthenticationState AuthenticationState { get; set; } = 
        new ApplicationAuthenticationState();
}
```

## Customize app routes

By default, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication` library uses the routes shown in the following table for representing different authentication states.

| Route                            | Purpose |
| -------------------------------- | ------- |
| `authentication/login`           | Triggers a sign-in operation. |
| `authentication/login-callback`  | Handles the result of any sign-in operation. |
| `authentication/login-failed`    | Displays error messages when the sign-in operation fails for some reason. |
| `authentication/logout`          | Triggers a sign-out operation. |
| `authentication/logout-callback` | Handles the result of a sign-out operation. |
| `authentication/logout-failed`   | Displays error messages when the sign-out operation fails for some reason. |
| `authentication/logged-out`      | Indicates that the user has successfully logout. |
| `authentication/profile`         | Triggers an operation to edit the user profile. |
| `authentication/register`        | Triggers an operation to register a new user. |

The routes shown in the preceding table are configurable via `RemoteAuthenticationOptions<TProviderOptions>.AuthenticationPaths`. When setting options to provide custom routes, confirm that the app has a route that handles each path.

In the following example, all the paths are prefixed with `/security`.

`Authentication` component (*Pages/Authentication.razor*):

```razor
@page "/security/{action}"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication

<RemoteAuthenticatorView Action="@Action" />

@code{
    [Parameter]
    public string Action { get; set; }
}
```

`Program.Main` (*Program.cs*):

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthorization(options => { 
    options.AuthenticationPaths.LogInPath = "security/login";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.LogInCallbackPath = "security/login-callback";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.LogInFailedPath = "security/login-failed";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.LogOutPath = "security/logout";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.LogOutCallbackPath = "security/logout-callback";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.LogOutFailedPath = "security/logout-failed";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.LogOutSucceededPath = "security/logged-out";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.ProfilePath = "security/profile";
    options.AuthenticationPaths.RegisterPath = "security/register";
});
```

If the requirement calls for completely different paths, set the routes as described previously and render the `RemoteAuthenticatorView` with an explicit action parameter:

```razor
@page "/register"

<RemoteAuthenticatorView Action="@RemoteAuthenticationActions.Register" />
```

You're allowed to break the UI into different pages if you choose to do so.

## Customize the authentication user interface

`RemoteAuthenticatorView` includes a default set of UI pieces for each authentication state. Each state can be customized by passing in a custom `RenderFragment`. To customize the displayed text during the initial login process, can change the `RemoteAuthenticatorView` as follows.

`Authentication` component (*Pages/Authentication.razor*):

```razor
@page "/security/{action}"
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication

<RemoteAuthenticatorView Action="@Action">
    <LoggingIn>
        You are about to be redirected to https://login.microsoftonline.com.
    </LoggingIn>
</RemoteAuthenticatorView>

@code{
    [Parameter]
    public string Action { get; set; }
}
```

The `RemoteAuthenticatorView` has one fragment that can be used per authentication route shown in the following table.

| Route                            | Fragment                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `authentication/login`           | `<LoggingIn>`           |
| `authentication/login-callback`  | `<CompletingLoggingIn>` |
| `authentication/login-failed`    | `<LogInFailed>`         |
| `authentication/logout`          | `<LogOut>`              |
| `authentication/logout-callback` | `<CompletingLogOut>`    |
| `authentication/logout-failed`   | `<LogOutFailed>`        |
| `authentication/logged-out`      | `<LogOutSucceeded>`     |
| `authentication/profile`         | `<UserProfile>`         |
| `authentication/register`        | `<Registering>`         |
