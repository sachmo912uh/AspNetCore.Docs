[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/razor-components-preview-notice.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to build a Razor Components app and demonstrates basic Razor Components framework concepts.

[View or download sample code](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/tutorials/build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples/) ([how to download](xref:index#how-to-download-a-sample)). See the [Get started](xref:razor-components/get-started) topic for prerequisites.

## Create an app from the Razor Components template

Follow the guidance in the [Get started](xref:razor-components/get-started) topic to create a Razor Components project from the Razor Components template. Name the solution *WebApplication1*. You can use Visual Studio or a command shell with .NET Core CLI commands.

## Build components

1. Browse to each of the app's three pages: Home, Counter, and Fetch data. These pages are implemented by Razor files in the *WebApplication1.App/Pages* folder: *Index.cshtml*, *Counter.cshtml*, and *FetchData.cshtml*.

1. On the Counter page, select the **Click me** button to increment the counter without a page refresh. Incrementing a counter in a webpage normally requires writing JavaScript, but Razor Components provides a better approach using C#.

1. Examine the implementation of the Counter component in the *Counter.cshtml* file.

   *WebApplication1.App/Pages/Counter.cshtml*:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/Counter1.cshtml)]

   The UI of the Counter component is defined using HTML. Dynamic rendering logic (for example, loops, conditionals, expressions) is added using an embedded C# syntax called [Razor](xref:mvc/views/razor). The HTML markup and C# rendering logic are converted into a component class at build time. The name of the generated .NET class matches the file name.

   Members of the component class are defined in a `@functions` block. In the `@functions` block, component state (properties, fields) and methods are specified for event handling or for defining other component logic. These members are then used as part of the component's rendering logic and for handling events.

   When the **Click me** button is selected:

   * The Counter component's registered `onclick` handler is called (the `IncrementCount` method).
   * The Counter component regenerates its render tree.
   * The new render tree is compared to the previous one.
   * Only modifications to the Document Object Model (DOM) are applied. The displayed count is updated.

1. Modify the C# logic of the Counter component to make the count increment by two instead of one.

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/Counter2.cshtml?highlight=14)]

1. Rebuild and run the app to see the changes. Select the **Click me** button, and the counter increments by two.

## Use components

Include a component into another component using an HTML-like syntax.

1. Add the Counter component to the app's Index (home page) component by adding a `<Counter />` element to the Index component.

   *WebApplication1.App/Pages/Index.cshtml*:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/Index.cshtml?highlight=7)]

1. Rebuild and run the app. The home page has its own counter.

## Component parameters

Components can also have parameters. Component parameters are defined using non-public properties on the component class decorated with `[Parameter]`. Use attributes to specify arguments for a component in markup.

1. Update the component's `@functions` C# code:

   * Add a `IncrementAmount` property decorated with the `[Parameter]` attribute.
   * Change the `IncrementCount` method to use the `IncrementAmount` when increasing the value of `currentCount`.

   *WebApplication1.App/Pages/Counter.cshtml*:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples/3.x/WebApplication1/WebApplication1.App/Pages/Counter.cshtml?highlight=12,16)]

<!-- Add back when supported.
   > [!NOTE]
   > From Visual Studio, you can quickly add a component parameter by using the `para` snippet. Type `para` and press the `Tab` key twice.
-->

1. Specify an `IncrementAmount` parameter in the Home component's `<Counter>` element using an attribute. Set the value to increment the counter by ten.

   *WebApplication1.App/Pages/Index.cshtml*:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples/3.x/WebApplication1/WebApplication1.App/Pages/Index.cshtml?highlight=7)]

1. Reload the page. The home page counter increments by ten each time the **Click me** button is selected. The counter on the *Counter* page increments by one.

## Route to components

The `@page` directive at the top of the *Counter.cshtml* file specifies that this component is a routing endpoint. The Counter component handles requests sent to `/Counter`. Without the `@page` directive, the component doesn't handle routed requests, but the component can still be used by other components.

## Dependency injection

Services registered in the app's service container are available to components via [dependency injection (DI)](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection). Inject services into a component using the `@inject` directive.

Examine the directives of the FetchData component (*WebApplication1.App/Pages/FetchData.cshtml*). The `@inject` directive is used to inject the instance of the `WeatherForecastService` service into the component:

[!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData1.cshtml?highlight=3)]

The `WeatherForecastService` service is registered as a [singleton](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes), so one instance of the service is available throughout the app.

The FetchData component uses the injected service, as `ForecastService`, to retrieve an array of `WeatherForecast` objects:

[!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData2.cshtml?highlight=6)]

A [@foreach](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in) loop is used to render each forecast instance as a row in the table of weather data:

[!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData3.cshtml?highlight=11-19)]

## Build a todo list

Add a new page to the app that implements a simple todo list.

1. Add an empty file to the *WebApplication1.App/Pages* folder named *Todo.cshtml*.

1. Provide the initial markup for the page:

   ```cshtml
   @page "/todo"

   <h1>Todo</h1>
   ```

1. Add the Todo page to the navigation bar.

   The NavMenu component (*WebApplication1/Shared/NavMenu.csthml*) is used in the app's layout. Layouts are components that allow you to avoid duplication of content in the app. For more information, see <xref:razor-components/layouts>.

   Add a `<NavLink>` for the Todo page by adding the following list item markup below the existing list items in the *WebApplication1/Shared/NavMenu.csthml* file:

   ```cshtml
   <li class="nav-item px-3">
       <NavLink class="nav-link" href="todo">
           <span class="oi oi-list-rich" aria-hidden="true"></span> Todo
       </NavLink>
   </li>
   ```

1. Rebuild and run the app. Visit the new Todo page to confirm that the link to the Todo page works.

1. Add a *TodoItem.cs* file to the root of the project to hold a class that represents a todo item. Use the following C# code for the `TodoItem` class:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples/3.x/WebApplication1/WebApplication1.App/TodoItem.cs)]

1. Return to the Todo component (*Todo.cshtml*):

   * Add a field for the todos in an `@functions` block. The Todo component uses this field to maintain the state of the todo list.
   * Add unordered list markup and a `foreach` loop to render each todo item as a list item.

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData4.cshtml?highlight=5-10,12-14)]

1. The app requires UI elements for adding todos to the list. Add a text input and a button below the list:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData5.cshtml?highlight=12-13)]

1. Rebuild and run the app. When the **Add todo** button is selected, nothing happens because an event handler isn't wired up to the button.

1. Add an `AddTodo` method to the Todo component and register it for button clicks using the `onclick` attribute:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData6.cshtml?highlight=2,7-10)]

   The `AddTodo` C# method is called when the button is selected.

1. To get the title of the new todo item, add a `newTodo` string field and bind it to the value of the text input using the `bind` attribute:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData7.cshtml?highlight=2)]

   ```cshtml
   <input placeholder="Something todo" bind="@newTodo" />
   ```

1. Update the `AddTodo` method to add the `TodoItem` with the specified title to the list. Clear the value of the text input by setting `newTodo` to an empty string:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData8.cshtml?highlight=19-26)]

1. Rebuild and run the app. Add some todos to the todo list to test the new code.

1. The title text for each todo item can be made editable and a check box can help the user keep track of completed items. Add a check box input for each todo item and bind its value to the `IsDone` property. Change `@todo.Title` to an `<input>` element bound to `@todo.Title`:

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples_snapshot/3.x/FetchData9.cshtml?highlight=5-6)]

1. To verify that these values are bound, update the `<h1>` header to show a count of the number of todo items that aren't complete (`IsDone` is `false`).

   ```cshtml
   <h1>Todo (@todos.Count(todo => !todo.IsDone))</h1>
   ```

1. The completed Todo component (*Todo.cshtml*):

   [!code-cshtml[](build-your-first-razor-components-app/samples/3.x/WebApplication1/WebApplication1.App/Pages/Todo.cshtml)]

1. Rebuild and run the app. Add todo items to test the new code.
