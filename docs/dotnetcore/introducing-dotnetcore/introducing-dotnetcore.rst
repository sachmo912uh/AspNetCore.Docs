.NET Core is a small, optimized runtime that can be targeted by ASP.NET 5 applications. In fact, the new ASP.NET 5 project templates target .NET Core by default, in addition to the full .NET Framework. Learn what targeting .NET Core, or *dnxcore50*, means for your ASP.NET 5 application.

What is .NET Core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.NET Core 5 is a modular runtime and library implementation that includes a subset of the full .NET Framework. Currently it builds and runs on Windows, but support for Linux and Mac is under development. .NET Core consists of a set of libraries, called "CoreFX", and a small, optimized runtime, called "CoreCLR". .NET Core is open-source, so you can follow progress on the project and contribute to it on GitHub:
	- `.NET Core Libraries <https://github.com/dotnet/corefx>`_
	- `.NET Core Common Language Runtime (CoreCLR) <https://github.com/dotnet/coreCLR>`_

The CoreCLR runtime is made available via NuGet (Microsoft.CoreCLR); the CoreFX library is also available as a set of individual NuGet packages, factored according to functionality. These packages are named "System.[module]" on `Nuget.org <http://www.nuget.org/>`_.
