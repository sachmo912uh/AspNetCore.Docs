===============================================

This article describes how to publish an ASP.NET web app to Azure using Visual Studio. 

**Note:** To complete this tutorial, you need a Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can `activate your MSDN subscriber benefits`_ or `sign up for a free trial`_.

Start by either creating a new ASP.NET web app or opening an existing ASP.NET web app. 

1. In **Solution Explorer** of Visual Studio, right-click on the project and select **Publish**.

4. Enter a site name and region. You can optionally create a new database server, however if you've created a database server in the past, use that. When you're ready to continue, click **Create**.

Database servers are a precious resource. For test and development it's best to use an existing server. There is **no** validation on the database password, so if you enter an incorrect value, you won't get an error until your web app attempts to access the database.

5. On the **Connection** tab of the **Publish Web** dialog box, click **Publish**.

You can view the publishing progress in the **Web Publish Activity** window within Visual Studio.

When publishing to Azure is complete, your web app will be displayed in a browser running on Azure.
