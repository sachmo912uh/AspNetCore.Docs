Adding a view
==================================================

By `Rick Anderson`_

In this section you're going to modify the ``HelloWorldController`` class to use Razor view template files to cleanly encapsulate the process of generating HTML responses to a client.

You'll create a view template file using the Razor view engine. Razor-based view templates have a *.cshtml* file extension, and provide an elegant way to create HTML output using C#. Razor minimizes the number of characters and keystrokes required when writing a view template, and enables a fast, fluid coding workflow.

Currently the ``Index`` method returns a string with a message that is hard-coded in the controller class. Change the ``Index`` method to return a View object, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs
	:language: c#
	:lines: 102-105
	:dedent: 8

The ``Index`` method above uses a view template to generate an HTML response to the browser. Controller methods (also known as `action methods <http://rachelappel.com/asp.net-mvc-actionresults-explained>`__), such as the ``Index`` method above, generally return an ``IActionResult`` (or a class derived from ``ActionResult``), not primitive types like string. 

- Right click on the *Views* folder, and then **Add > New Folder** and name the folder *HelloWorld*.

- Right click on the *Views/HelloWorld* folder, and then **Add > New Item**.
- In the **Add New Item - Movie** dialog

	- In the search box in the upper-right, enter *view*
	- Tap **MVC View Page**
	- In the **Name** box, keep the default *Index.cshtml*
	- Tap **Add**

Replace the contents of the *Views/HelloWorld/Index.cshtml* Razor view file with the following:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/HelloWorld/Index.cshtml
	:language: HTML

Navigate to ``http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld``. The ``Index`` method in the ``HelloWorldController`` didn't do much work; it simply ran the statement ``return View();``, which specified that the method should use a view template file to render a response to the browser. Because you didn't explicitly specify the name of the view template file to use, MVC defaulted to using the *Index.cshtml* view file in the */Views/HelloWorld* folder. The image below shows the string "Hello from our View Template!" hard-coded in the view.

If your browser window is small (for example on a mobile device), you might need to toggle (tap) the `Bootstrap navigation button <http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar>`__ in the upper right to see the to the **Home**, **About**, **Contact**, **Register** and **Log in** links.

Changing views and layout pages
--------------------------------------

Tap on the menu links (**MvcMovie**, **Home**, **About**). Each page shows the same menu layout. The menu layout is implemented in the *Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml* file. Open the *Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml* file.

Layout templates allow you to specify the HTML container layout of your site in one place and then apply it across multiple pages in your site. Find the ``@RenderBody()`` line. ``RenderBody`` is a placeholder where all the view-specific pages you create show up, "wrapped" in the layout page. For example, if you select the **About** link, the **Views/Home/About.cshtml** view is rendered inside the ``RenderBody`` method.

Change the contents of the title element. Change the anchor text in the layout template to "MVC Movie" and the controller from ``Home`` to ``Movies`` as highlighted below:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml
	:language: HTML
	:linenos: 
	:emphasize-lines: 6, 29

.. note:: We haven't implemented the ``Movies`` controller yet, so if you click on that link, you'll get an error.

Save your changes and tap the **About** link. Notice how each page displays the **Mvc Movie** link. We were able to make the change once in the layout template and have all pages on the site reflect the new link text and new title.

Examine the *Views/_ViewStart.cshtml* file:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/_ViewStart.cshtml
	:language: HTML
	
The *Views/_ViewStart.cshtml* file brings in the *Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml* file to each view. You can use the ``Layout`` property to set a different layout view, or set it to ``null`` so no layout file will be used.

Now, let's change the title of the ``Index`` view.

Open *Views/HelloWorld/Index.cshtml*. There are two places to make a change: 

 - The text that appears in the title of the browser
 - The secondary header (``<h2>`` element). 

You'll make them slightly different so you can see which bit of code changes which part of the app.

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/HelloWorld/Index2.cshtml
	:language: HTML
	:linenos: 
	:emphasize-lines: 2, 5
	
Line number 2 in the code above sets the ``Title`` property of the `ViewDataDictionary <https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Razor/RazorPageOfT.cs>`__ to "Movie List". The ``Title`` property is used in the ``<title>`` HTML element in the layout page:

.. code-block:: HTML

	<title>@ViewData["Title"] - Movie App</title>

Save your change and refresh the page. Notice that the browser title, the primary heading, and the secondary headings have changed. (If you don't see changes in the browser, you might be viewing cached content. Press Ctrl+F5 in your browser to force the response from the server to be loaded.) The browser title is created with ``ViewData["Title"]`` we set in the **Index.cshtml** view template and the additional "- Movie App" added in the layout file.

Also notice how the content in the *Index.cshtml* view template was merged with the *Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml* view template and a single HTML response was sent to the browser. Layout templates make it really easy to make changes that apply across all of the pages in your application.

Our little bit of "data" (in this case the "Hello from our View Template!" message) is hard-coded, though. The MVC application has a "V" (view) and you've got a "C" (controller), but no "M" (model) yet. Shortly, we'll walk through how create a database and retrieve model data from it.

Passing Data from the Controller to the View
-----------------------------------------------

Before we go to a database and talk about models, though, let's first talk about passing information from the controller to a view. Controller classes are invoked in response to an incoming URL request. A controller class is where you write the code that handles the incoming browser requests, retrieves data from a database, and ultimately decides what type of response to send back to the browser. View templates can then be used from a controller to generate and format an HTML response to the browser.

Controllers are responsible for providing whatever data or objects are required in order for a view template to render a response to the browser. A best practice: A view template should never perform business logic or interact with a database directly. Instead, a view template should work only with the data that's provided to it by the controller. Maintaining this "separation of concerns" helps keep your code clean, testable and more maintainable.

Currently, the ``Welcome`` method in the ``HelloWorldController`` class takes a ``name`` and a ``numTimes`` parameter and then outputs the values directly to the browser. Rather than have the controller render this response as a string, letâ€™s change the controller to use a view template instead. The view template will generate a dynamic response, which means that you need to pass appropriate bits of data from the controller to the view in order to generate the response. You can do this by having the controller put the dynamic data (parameters) that the view template needs in a ``ViewData`` dictionary that the view template can then access.

Return to the *HelloWorldController.cs* file and change the ``Welcome`` method to add a ``Message`` and ``NumTimes`` value to the ``ViewData`` dictionary. The ``ViewData`` dictionary is a dynamic object, which means you can put whatever you want in to it; the ``ViewData`` object has no defined properties until you put something inside it. The `MVC model binding system <http://docs.asp.net/projects/mvc/en/latest/models/index.html>`__ automatically maps the named parameters (``name`` and ``numTimes``) from the query string in the address bar to parameters in your method. The complete *HelloWorldController.cs* file looks like this:
	
.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Controllers/HelloWorldController.cs
	:language: c#
	:lines: 152-171

The ``ViewData`` dictionary object contains data that will be passed to the view. Next, you need a Welcome view template.

- Right click on the *Views/HelloWorld* folder, and then **Add > New Item**.
- In the **Add New Item - Movie** dialog

	- In the search box in the upper-right, enter *view*
	- Tap **MVC View Page**
	- In the **Name** box, enter *Welcome.cshtml*
	- Tap **Add**

You'll create a loop in the *Welcome.cshtml* view template that displays "Hello" ``NumTimes``. Replace the contents of *Views/HelloWorld/Welcome.cshtml* with the following:

.. literalinclude:: start-mvc/sample/src/MvcMovie/Views/HelloWorld/Welcome.cshtml
	:language: HTML

Save your changes and browse to the following URL:

http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/Welcome?name=Rick&numtimes=4

Data is taken from the URL and passed to the controller using the `model binder <http://docs.asp.net/projects/mvc/en/latest/models/index.html>`__. The controller packages the data into a ``ViewData`` dictionary and passes that object to the view. The view then renders the data as HTML to the browser.

.. image:: adding-view/_static/rick.png

In the sample above, we used the ``ViewData`` dictionary to pass data from the controller to a view. Later in the tutorial, we will use a view model to pass data from a controller to a view. The view model approach to passing data is generally much preferred over the ``ViewData`` dictionary approach. See `Dynamic V Strongly Typed Views <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rickandy/archive/2011/01/28/dynamic-v-strongly-typed-views.aspx>`__ for more information.

Well, that was a kind of an "M" for model, but not the database kind. Let's take what we've learned and create a database of movies.
